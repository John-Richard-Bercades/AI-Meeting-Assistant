# Security Implementation Guide

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Meeting Assistant application.

## Authentication

### JWT-Based Authentication

The application uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication:

1. **Token Generation**: When a user logs in successfully, a JWT token is generated with the user's ID and username.
2. **Token Storage**: The token is stored in an HTTP-only cookie, which cannot be accessed by JavaScript.
3. **Token Verification**: Protected routes verify the token before allowing access.

### Password Security

1. **Hashing**: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with a salt factor of 10.
2. **No Plain Text**: Passwords are never stored or transmitted in plain text.

## API Security

### CSRF Protection

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection is implemented:

1. **Token-Based**: A CSRF token is required for all state-changing operations.
2. **Cookie + Header**: The double submit cookie pattern is used.
3. **Per-Session Tokens**: Each user session has its own CSRF token.

### Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is implemented to prevent brute force attacks:

1. **Login Endpoint**: Limited to 5 attempts per 15 minutes.
2. **General API**: Limited to 100 requests per minute.

### CORS Configuration

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is configured:

1. **Restricted Origins**: Only specified origins can access the API.
2. **Credentials**: Credentials are allowed for authenticated requests.

## Data Security

### Input Validation

1. **Server-Side Validation**: All inputs are validated on the server side.
2. **Parameterized Queries**: SQL queries use parameterized statements to prevent SQL injection.

### Error Handling

1. **Sanitized Errors**: Error messages do not expose sensitive information.
2. **Logging**: Errors are logged for monitoring but sensitive data is redacted.

## Secure Cookies

1. **HTTP-Only**: Authentication cookies are HTTP-only.
2. **Secure Flag**: In production, cookies are only sent over HTTPS.
3. **SameSite**: Cookies use SameSite=Strict to prevent CSRF.

## Best Practices for Developers

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
2. **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive configuration in environment variables, not in code.
3. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production.
4. **JWT Secret**: Use a strong, unique JWT secret key in production.

## Security Roadmap

Future security improvements planned:

1. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Implement 2FA for additional security.
2. **Password Policies**: Enforce strong password requirements.
3. **Account Lockout**: Implement account lockout after multiple failed login attempts.
4. **Security Headers**: Add security headers like Content-Security-Policy.
5. **Audit Logging**: Implement comprehensive audit logging for security events.
